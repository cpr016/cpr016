### This Github is a WIP.
Many projects do not have comprehensive READMEs explaining how to run them nor many of the finer details on the project.



# Navigation
I have broken up my programming projects into categories via organizations.

## School Projects
#### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects
#### Description: This organization contains repositories for the important high-level courses during my time in college. The courses are ordered by importance, in my opinion.

### Design of Computing Algorithms - COS 485
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects/Algorithms
An introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. This course develops useful algorithm design techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, the greedy method, searching, iterative improvement, and randomized algorithms. We will study important problems such as sorting, searching, minimum spanning tree, single source shortest path, traveling salesperson, graph search and others. This course develops mathematical techniques for analyzing and comparing the execution times of algorithms and for finding lower bounds on the best possible algorithms.

### Capstone - Object Oriented Design and Programming - COS 420
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects/Capstone
This course will focus on the construction of object oriented software. Students will learn conceptual models for organizing objects and object hierarchies, an object oriented design notation and the application of design patterns. These capabilities will be used to solve relatively complex problems as a part of software development teams.

### Mobile Application Development - COS 470
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects/Mobile-App-Development
The objectives of the course are as follows: Develop basic skill in app development on iOS, Android, and hybrid platforms, develop moderate skill and knowledge of a single platform, develop basic skill in server-side development for mobile platforms, and understand the design and interface layout process for mobile applications.

### Computer Graphics - COS 452
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects/Computer-Graphics
We explore graphics hardware, algorithms for generating graphics primitives (lines, circles, ...), geogeometric transformations (scaling, rotation, ...), mathematical transformations for viewing, surface rendering methods, lighting, animation, and texture mapping. This material in this course is tightly integrated with a programming component that is based on the OpenGL/WebGL API.

### Database Systems - COS 457
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects/Database-Systems
There are three primary objectives of the course. The first is to acquaint the students with the purposes, concepts, and terminology associated with database management systems, so that the student understands what functions these systems provide. In particular, the course teaches the data definition, data manipulation, and control features of the standard relational language, SQL, especially its querying capability via the SELECT statement.

The second purpose is to instruct the student in a design methodology for the development of specific databases using commercial database system packages. Particular attention is paid to conceptual or semantic modeling of the application in the design and to rational choice of physical file structures. Included in this area are the features of the Entity-Relationship(ER) model, the relational model, and functional dependency theory.

The course will also provide the student with knowledge of the languages and techniques for making a database accessible over the internet, and discuss the SQL injection attack hazard in connection with the JDBC interface to databases.

### Graphical User Interface Design - COS 368
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-school-projects/GUI-Design
Principles of graphical user interface design are utilized to build working interfaces. The programming languages used will be C# and Xamarin for cross-platform app development. Students will work in an object-oriented, event-driven environment.

## Hobby Projects
#### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-hobby-projects
#### Description: This organization contains repositories for the important projects that I made for leisure or to solve a problem I had. 

### Strategy Cube Project
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-hobby-projects/Strategy-Cube-Project
This is a simple strategy game that I made for fun. 

The goal is to take over the nodes before the AI does. For every node you own, you gain a flat amount of cubes per second. You then send this cubes to other nodes to capture them. 

### Finis Bot
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-hobby-projects/Finis-Bot
This is the code I used for a discord bot called Finis Bot, which I use on one of my personal discord servers.

The bot only has two functions:
1. Allow users to create a private text and voice channel combination that they have administrative permissions over.
1. Announce in one of these private text channels when a voice call is started in the respective voice channel. 

### Ghost Mod
##### Link: https://github.com/cpr016-hobby-projects/Ghost-Mod
I created a Minecraft mod to solve a problem on my modded Minecraft server. I wanted mobs to be difficult, but a decent house would prevent any mobs from entering, and I didn't want the mobs to destroy the house to get to the players. So I created ghosts.
